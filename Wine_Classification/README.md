# Wine Classification

Wine classification is one of my self-projects to classify whether the wine is good or bad. The machine learning algorithm was created in July 2022. To compare the results, the neural network algorithm was added in April 2023. Any recommendation or suggestion is acceptable for my evaluation. Thanks a lot!
