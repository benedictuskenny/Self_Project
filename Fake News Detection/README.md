One of the most harmful aspects of social media applications is the spreading of fake news. That's why machine learning can be used to detect whether the news is fake or real based on the headline. You can download the dataset here: https://www.kaggle.com/hassanamin/textdb3/download



In this project, I used basic machine learning with the Naive Bayes algorithm and NLP. Anyway, there is something interesting if you follow these steps :D

1. Download "fake_news_vecs.tsv" and "fake_news_meta.tsv"

2. Go to https://projector.tensorflow.org/

3. Click "load" on the left side.

4. Upload "fake_news_vecs.tsv" at Load a TSV file of vectors.

5. Upload "fake_news_meta.tsv" at Load a TSV file of metadata.

6. Click anywhere to close it.

7. Voila! You can search for your desired words (i.e., politics and California) with the search feature on the right side.
